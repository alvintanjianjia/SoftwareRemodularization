### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Fix https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13828 and fix
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13050

This patch will fix a miscaculation of block to async cache

In earlier Alluxio versions prior to
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/13064, users may see the
following errors:
```
2021-03-12 08:36:48,521 ERROR AlluxioFuseFileSystem - Failed to read
file=/data/0.5G_9.txt, offset=536862720, size=8192
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 4, Size: 4
```

After 13064, we will not see the error anymore but caching the last
block when fileSize happens on block size boundary will fail silently.

### Why are the changes needed?

Correct a bug when calculating the block id to async cache, when current
pos is fileSize which is a multiple of blockSize

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

No

Add functions to URIStatus to track bytes read from cache and external
file system in a per-read basis.
The default implementation does nothing. It is up to the subclass to
decide how to track them.
Presto will use this information to compute query level metrics.
See https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/16237 for details.

Clean up the test class hierarchy for the EventStorageEngine test
implementations, by:
- Clearing out use of public as that's not needed for JUnit 5
- Removing any present warnings, by:
 * Removing deprecated usage
 * Asserting optionals prior to performing a get
 * Making inner classes static
 * Suppressing SQL validation in the JDBC test class
 * Adding missing generics
- Adding slightly clearer class level javadoc

Adjust all the CommandMessageFilter implementations to be
de-/serializable through the JacksonSerializer. As such it would be
beneficial to provide distinct parameterized serialization test cases
for all implementations, going over the set of available serializers.
This will likely adjust all CommandMessageFilter impls to contain JSON
specific annotations.

Change the SnapshotFilter API to be more to the point. In doing so,
rename `filter` to `allow`, as the function should allow or reject
snapshot data. On top, only the `and` operation is used, which logically
 should be `combine`, as you'd combine these allow methods, not ""and""
 them.
