Instead of having a single HandlerAttributes object, change it into an
interface with two implementations: an annotation based version and a
default Map version. The former should be used by the
AnnotatedMessageHandlingMember, whereas the latter serves the purpose of
 opening up custom MessageHandlingMember which decide to not use
 annotations at all. Additionally, remove the attributes() and isA()
 methods from the MessageHandlingMember, as they do not add any value.

Add test cases which validate a command handler on an aggregate member

dispatch to a concrete implementation. Furthermore, validate that
command handler interceptors for the same command within a single
