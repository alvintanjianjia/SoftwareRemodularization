Currently all the worker metadata are wrapped in `MasterWorkerInfo`
object on the master side. This includes worker metadata, usage and the
various block lists. The existing `DefaultBlockMaster` does a
`synchronized (MasterWorkerInfo)` locking on this object on every read
or write operation on any field in this object. This locking is
excessive.

By refactoring this `MasterWorkerInfo` object and refactoring the
locking mechanism, the `DefaultBlockMaster` concurrency will be
improved, as multiple operations will be able to happen on the same
worker.

That said, this PR aims at the following:
1. Refactor `MasterWorkerInfo` object. Break this into multiple parts
which can be individually locked and updated.
2. Refactor the locking to lock individual parts on the object instead
of the whole object. RW Locking should also be applied.

Improve efficiency of `distributedLoad` in two fold:
1. calling `BlockInStream.create` to obtain the InputStream without RPC,
where the original `blockStore.getOutStream(blockId,...)` makes one RPC
to master to get blockInfo.
2. removing using `BlockOutStream` and only reads the block data to
alluxio job worker without writing it back to the block store on worker.
This will further save at least two RPCs and the overhead to transfer
data back to worker.

Note that, the original code is not removed to handle the case Pinned
Media, because currently reading a block does not support promoting this
block to a medium but only a tier. After discussed with @calvinjia , we
will leave this once we consolidate medium and tier on worker

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Fix https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13828 and fix
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13050

This patch will fix a miscaculation of block to async cache

In earlier Alluxio versions prior to
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/13064, users may see the
following errors:
```
2021-03-12 08:36:48,521 ERROR AlluxioFuseFileSystem - Failed to read
file=/data/0.5G_9.txt, offset=536862720, size=8192
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 4, Size: 4
```

After 13064, we will not see the error anymore but caching the last
block when fileSize happens on block size boundary will fail silently.

### Why are the changes needed?

Correct a bug when calculating the block id to async cache, when current
pos is fileSize which is a multiple of blockSize

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

No

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Improve conformance of the S3 API to the specification defined by AWS.

### Why are the changes needed?

The AWS CLI does not work for many standard operations (e.g. listing
buckets, setting max number of return keys, copying between buckets)

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

This affects some of the values from the S3 API to be in-line with more
of the S3 REST API specification. It can potentially break backwards
compatibility with previous versions.

### PR Summary

This PR is a a serious of small changes and improvements to the S3
API which improves the conformance to the specification defined
by the AWS Rest API reference at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Type_API_Reference.html

A short summary of the changes:

- Implement the CopyObjectResult type for bucket-bucket transfers
- Make the ListAllMyBucketsResult conform to the spec. Added
creationDate and proper timestamps to results
- ListBucketOptions now includes the delimiter and encoding type
parameters
- the listBucketResult uses the CommonPrefix type and now includes
the delimiter and encoding type. Additionally, make sure keyCount
and truncation takes into account the common prefixes
- Update the S3RestServiceHandler to use Java 8 lambda language
features
- Update credentials to use the latest amazon authorization format
- A potentially breaking change which causes a ListAllMyBuckets result
to only return folders

Add functions to URIStatus to track bytes read from cache and external
file system in a per-read basis.
The default implementation does nothing. It is up to the subclass to
decide how to track them.
Presto will use this information to compute query level metrics.
See https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/16237 for details.
