Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This fixes two problems with S3Guard authoritative mode and
the auth directory flags which are stored in DynamoDB.

1. mkdirs was creating dir markers without the auth bit,
   forcing needless scans on newly created directories and
   files subsequently added; it was only with the first listStatus call
   on that directory that the dir would be marked as authoritative -even
   though it would be complete already.

2. listStatus(path) would reset the authoritative status bit of all
   child directories even if they were already marked as authoritative.

Issue #2 is possibly the most expensive, as any treewalk using listStatus
(e.g globfiles) would clear the auth bit for all child directories before
listing them. And this would happen every single time...
essentially you weren't getting authoritative directory listings.

For the curious, that the major bug was actually found during testing
-we'd all missed it during reviews.

A lesson there: the better the tests the fewer the bugs.

Maybe also: something obvious and significant can get by code reviews.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

During S3A rename() and delete() calls, the list of objects delete is
built up into batches of a thousand and then POSTed in a single large
DeleteObjects request.

But as the IO capacity allowed on an S3 partition may only be 3500 writes
per second *and* each entry in that POST counts as a single write, then
one of those posts alone can trigger throttling on an already loaded
S3 directory tree. Which can trigger backoff and retry, with the same
thousand entry post, and so recreate the exact same problem.

Fixes

* Page size for delete object requests is set in
  fs.s3a.bulk.delete.page.size; the default is 250.
* The property fs.s3a.experimental.aws.s3.throttling (default=true)
  can be set to false to disable throttle retry logic in the AWS
  client SDK -it is all handled in the S3A client. This
  gives more visibility in to when operations are being throttled
* Bulk delete throttling events are logged to the log
  org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.throttled log at INFO; if this appears
  often then choose a smaller page size.
* The metric ""store_io_throttled"" adds the entire count of delete
  requests when a single DeleteObjects request is throttled.
* A new quantile, ""store_io_throttle_rate"" can track throttling
  load over time.
* DynamoDB metastore throttle resilience issues have also been
  identified and fixed. Note: the fs.s3a.experimental.aws.s3.throttling
  flag does not apply to DDB IO precisely because there may still be
  lurking issues there and it safest to rely on the DynamoDB client
  SDK.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

Replaces the committer-specific terasort and MR test jobs with parameterization
of the (now single tests) and use of file:// over hdfs:// as the cluster FS.

The parameterization ensures that only one of the specific committer tests
run at a time -overloads of the test machines are less likely, and so the
suites can be pulled back into the parallel phase.

There's also more detailed validation of the stage outputs of the terasorting;
if one test fails the rest are all skipped. This and the fact that job
output is stored under target/yarn-${timestamp} means failures should
be more debuggable.

Contains

- HADOOP-16397. Hadoop S3Guard Prune command to support a -tombstone option.
- HADOOP-16406. ITestDynamoDBMetadataStore.testProvisionTable times out intermittently

This patch doesn't fix the underlying problem but it

* changes some tests to clean up better
* does a lot more in logging operations in against DDB, if enabled
* adds an entry point to dump the state of the metastore and s3 tables (precursor to fsck)
* adds a purge entry point to help clean up after a test run has got a store into a mess
* s3guard prune command adds -tombstone option to only clear tombstones

The outcome is that tests should pass consistently and if problems occur we have better diagnostics.

S3A to implement S3 Select through this API.

The new openFile() API is asynchronous, and implemented across FileSystem and FileContext.

The MapReduce V2 inputs are moved to this API, and you can actually set must/may
options to pass in.

This is more useful for setting things like s3a seek policy than for S3 select,
as the existing input format/record readers can't handle S3 select output where
the stream is shorter than the file length, and splitting plain text is suboptimal.
Future work is needed there.

In the meantime, any/all filesystem connectors are now free to add their own filesystem-specific
configuration parameters which can be set in jobs and used to set filesystem input stream
options (seek policy, retry, encryption secrets, etc).
