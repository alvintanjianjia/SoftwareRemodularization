Currently all the worker metadata are wrapped in `MasterWorkerInfo`
object on the master side. This includes worker metadata, usage and the
various block lists. The existing `DefaultBlockMaster` does a
`synchronized (MasterWorkerInfo)` locking on this object on every read
or write operation on any field in this object. This locking is
excessive.

By refactoring this `MasterWorkerInfo` object and refactoring the
locking mechanism, the `DefaultBlockMaster` concurrency will be
improved, as multiple operations will be able to happen on the same
worker.

That said, this PR aims at the following:
1. Refactor `MasterWorkerInfo` object. Break this into multiple parts
which can be individually locked and updated.
2. Refactor the locking to lock individual parts on the object instead
of the whole object. RW Locking should also be applied.

Improve efficiency of `distributedLoad` in two fold:
1. calling `BlockInStream.create` to obtain the InputStream without RPC,
where the original `blockStore.getOutStream(blockId,...)` makes one RPC
to master to get blockInfo.
2. removing using `BlockOutStream` and only reads the block data to
alluxio job worker without writing it back to the block store on worker.
This will further save at least two RPCs and the overhead to transfer
data back to worker.

Note that, the original code is not removed to handle the case Pinned
Media, because currently reading a block does not support promoting this
block to a medium but only a tier. After discussed with @calvinjia , we
will leave this once we consolidate medium and tier on worker

After 13064, we will not see the error anymore but caching the last
block when fileSize happens on block size boundary will fail silently.

### Why are the changes needed?

Correct a bug when calculating the block id to async cache, when current
pos is fileSize which is a multiple of blockSize

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

No

### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Improve conformance of the S3 API to the specification defined by AWS.

### Why are the changes needed?

The AWS CLI does not work for many standard operations (e.g. listing
buckets, setting max number of return keys, copying between buckets)

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

This affects some of the values from the S3 API to be in-line with more
of the S3 REST API specification. It can potentially break backwards
compatibility with previous versions.

### PR Summary

This PR is a a serious of small changes and improvements to the S3
API which improves the conformance to the specification defined
by the AWS Rest API reference at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Type_API_Reference.html

A short summary of the changes:

- Implement the CopyObjectResult type for bucket-bucket transfers
- Make the ListAllMyBucketsResult conform to the spec. Added
creationDate and proper timestamps to results
- ListBucketOptions now includes the delimiter and encoding type
parameters
- the listBucketResult uses the CommonPrefix type and now includes
the delimiter and encoding type. Additionally, make sure keyCount
and truncation takes into account the common prefixes
- Update the S3RestServiceHandler to use Java 8 lambda language
features
- Update credentials to use the latest amazon authorization format
- A potentially breaking change which causes a ListAllMyBuckets result
to only return folders

The default implementation does nothing. It is up to the subclass to
decide how to track them.

The goal of these entry points was to provide Java6/Android compatible assertions but since we have moved to Java 8 it became more complicated, filtering out java 8 types is not sufficient as we have refactored some assertions implementation to use lambdas and streams that made them improper to use in Java 6.

Clean up the test class hierarchy for the EventStorageEngine test
implementations, by:
- Clearing out use of public as that's not needed for JUnit 5
- Removing any present warnings, by:
 * Removing deprecated usage
 * Asserting optionals prior to performing a get
 * Making inner classes static
 * Suppressing SQL validation in the JDBC test class
 * Adding missing generics
- Adding slightly clearer class level javadoc

The AggregateCreationPolicy#ALWAYS will default to returning the
aggregate identifier after command handling. Similar to a command
handling constructor. However, this policy allows to be placed on
regular methods thus opening up to several return values. Hence, default

This commit adds support for interceptors declared on the handler
instance itself, using the same rules for parameter injection as other
annotated handlers. Depending on the annotation used, handlers are also
given the opportunity to only act on the result of handler execution,
such as a specific type of exception.

Instead of having a single HandlerAttributes object, change it into an
interface with two implementations: an annotation based version and a
default Map version. The former should be used by the
AnnotatedMessageHandlingMember, whereas the latter serves the purpose of
 opening up custom MessageHandlingMember which decide to not use
 annotations at all. Additionally, remove the attributes() and isA()
 methods from the MessageHandlingMember, as they do not add any value.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This fixes two problems with S3Guard authoritative mode and
the auth directory flags which are stored in DynamoDB.

1. mkdirs was creating dir markers without the auth bit,
   forcing needless scans on newly created directories and
   files subsequently added; it was only with the first listStatus call
   on that directory that the dir would be marked as authoritative -even
   though it would be complete already.

2. listStatus(path) would reset the authoritative status bit of all
   child directories even if they were already marked as authoritative.

Issue #2 is possibly the most expensive, as any treewalk using listStatus
(e.g globfiles) would clear the auth bit for all child directories before
listing them. And this would happen every single time...
essentially you weren't getting authoritative directory listings.

For the curious, that the major bug was actually found during testing
-we'd all missed it during reviews.

A lesson there: the better the tests the fewer the bugs.

Maybe also: something obvious and significant can get by code reviews.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

During S3A rename() and delete() calls, the list of objects delete is
built up into batches of a thousand and then POSTed in a single large
DeleteObjects request.

But as the IO capacity allowed on an S3 partition may only be 3500 writes
per second *and* each entry in that POST counts as a single write, then
one of those posts alone can trigger throttling on an already loaded
S3 directory tree. Which can trigger backoff and retry, with the same
thousand entry post, and so recreate the exact same problem.

Fixes

* Page size for delete object requests is set in
  fs.s3a.bulk.delete.page.size; the default is 250.
* The property fs.s3a.experimental.aws.s3.throttling (default=true)
  can be set to false to disable throttle retry logic in the AWS
  client SDK -it is all handled in the S3A client. This
  gives more visibility in to when operations are being throttled
* Bulk delete throttling events are logged to the log
  org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.throttled log at INFO; if this appears
  often then choose a smaller page size.
* The metric ""store_io_throttled"" adds the entire count of delete
  requests when a single DeleteObjects request is throttled.
* A new quantile, ""store_io_throttle_rate"" can track throttling
  load over time.
* DynamoDB metastore throttle resilience issues have also been
  identified and fixed. Note: the fs.s3a.experimental.aws.s3.throttling
  flag does not apply to DDB IO precisely because there may still be
  lurking issues there and it safest to rely on the DynamoDB client
  SDK.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

Replaces the committer-specific terasort and MR test jobs with parameterization
of the (now single tests) and use of file:// over hdfs:// as the cluster FS.

The parameterization ensures that only one of the specific committer tests
run at a time -overloads of the test machines are less likely, and so the
suites can be pulled back into the parallel phase.

There's also more detailed validation of the stage outputs of the terasorting;
if one test fails the rest are all skipped. This and the fact that job
output is stored under target/yarn-${timestamp} means failures should
be more debuggable.

Contributed by Steve Loughran

Contains

- HADOOP-16397. Hadoop S3Guard Prune command to support a -tombstone option.
- HADOOP-16406. ITestDynamoDBMetadataStore.testProvisionTable times out intermittently

This patch doesn't fix the underlying problem but it

* changes some tests to clean up better
* does a lot more in logging operations in against DDB, if enabled
* adds an entry point to dump the state of the metastore and s3 tables (precursor to fsck)
* adds a purge entry point to help clean up after a test run has got a store into a mess
* s3guard prune command adds -tombstone option to only clear tombstones

The outcome is that tests should pass consistently and if problems occur we have better diagnostics.

S3A to implement S3 Select through this API.

The new openFile() API is asynchronous, and implemented across FileSystem and FileContext.

The MapReduce V2 inputs are moved to this API, and you can actually set must/may
options to pass in.

This is more useful for setting things like s3a seek policy than for S3 select,
as the existing input format/record readers can't handle S3 select output where
the stream is shorter than the file length, and splitting plain text is suboptimal.
Future work is needed there.

In the meantime, any/all filesystem connectors are now free to add their own filesystem-specific
configuration parameters which can be set in jobs and used to set filesystem input stream
options (seek policy, retry, encryption secrets, etc).

* [dart-dio] Remove old Dart 1.x templates

* [dart-dio] Initial version of a next-gen Dart Dio generator

* Fix a couple readme links and examples

* Fix import in testcase

* Add integration tests to master POM

* Run initial dart format and improve some base formatting

* Generate docs

* Use integer matchers in test for content-length

* Separate more built_value specific files

* Fix mustache partial path

* Update pubspec template

* Fix tests after mock lib updates

* Generate with new built_value pre-release

This solves the problem of not being able to serialize null.

* Update built_value dependency

* Regenerate after merge

* Regenerate tests

* Fix missing byte response cast

* Update dio to 4.0.0-prev1

* Run format

* Ignore unused imports in inheritance classes

* Update mock test library

* Update docs

* Make a couple variables final

* Update and freeze dio dependency

* Update generator doc

* Add a new option to post processes all dart output at once

This is much faster than individual files. The committed samples should be formatted since Dart is very opinionated and it makes diffs in PRs much easier to read.
Due to this, we also need to format in CI, otherwise there is a git diff.

    -- new: use tag only if useTags is enabled, use ""DefaultApi"" if not
* @path class level annotation
  - for all generators above and the microprofile generator (uses same jaxrs postprocessing)
  - extended the ""commonPath"" to contain more than only the root path if possible

This is causing the difference in samples

* :shirt::art: Minor refactor DefaultGenerator

This cleans up some lint warnings and improve general code cleanliness
of DefaultGenerator.

Specifically:

* logger strings are now using the built-in log formatter rather than
  constructing new strings regardless of log level.
* Diamond operators are used where possible
* Some long-unused commented code has been removed
* Lambdas are used where possible
* Redundant operations are merged (HashMap constructor used rather than
  subsequent putAll on a collection, for example)

* [cli][core] Add support for dry-run and display

CLI now supports `--dry-run`, which will output a file change status
similar to git status --porcelain.

The user may also specify `--verbose` for a one-liner below each file
explaining why the change operation might take place.",1ec2c260532df9dd20d10b216d4bcb96793b3fde,2020-02-18 20:28:26,5.0,1,Openapi-generator,db47b95fc948479e143f14c46a63c14171b51d03,52.0,51.0,53.0,1.4142135623730951,272.0,270.0,274.0,2.8284271247461903,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,297.5,289.0,306.0,12.020815280171304,122.5,109.0,136.0,19.091883092036785,31.0,30.0,32.0,1.4142135623730951,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,0.0,20.0,19.0,21.0,1.4142135623730951,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.5,20.0,21.0,0.7071067811865476,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.5,14.0,15.0,0.7071067811865476,6.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,84.5,83.0,86.0,2.1213203435596424,1107.0,1074.0,1140.0,46.66904755831214,27.5,27.0,28.0,0.7071067811865476,33.5,33.0,34.0,0.7071067811865476,25.5,25.0,26.0,0.7071067811865476,8.0,8.0,8.0,0.0,6.5,6.0,7.0,0.7071067811865476,211.5,211.0,212.0,0.7071067811865476,8.5,7.0,10.0,2.1213203435596424,220.0,220.0,220.0,0.0,20.5,20.0,21.0,0.7071067811865476,177.5,177.0,178.0,0.7071067811865476,6.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,8.0,12.0,2.8284271247461903,390.0,387.0,393.0,4.242640687119285,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,103.0,29.0,177.0,104.65180361560905,1456.0,1456,1456,0.0,2.0,2,2,0.0,790,1.0,5.0,408.7776,244.198399104,5142.4,899.6977787111128,3.0,1.6094379124341003,1

* [core] Extracting recommendations to validation framework

This is work to extract recommendation logic out of the CLI validate command
into a shared evaluation instance which can be used elsewhere (such as Gradle,
or the Online tool).

For now, these validations are in addition to those provided by swagger-parser and
are only the following recommendations:

* Apache/Nginx warning that header values with underscore are dropped by default
* Unused models/schemas
* Use of properties with oneOf, which is ambiguous in OpenAPI Specification

I've allowed for disabling recommendations via System properties, since this is
something that has been requested a few times by users. System properties in this
commit include:

* openapi.generator.rule.recommendations=false
  - Allows for disabling recommendations completely. This wouldn't include all warnings
    and errors, only those we deem to be suggestions
* openapi.generator.rule.apache-nginx-underscore=false
  - Allows for disabling the Apache/Nginx warning when header names have underscore
  - This is a legacy CGI configuration, and doesn't affect all web servers
* openapi.generator.rule.oneof-properties-ambiguity=false
  - We support this functionality, but the specification may not intend for it
  - This is more to reduce noise
* openapi.generator.rule.unused-schemas=false
  - We will warn when a schema is not referenced outside of Components, which
    users have requested to be able to turn off
* openapi.generator.rule.anti-patterns.uri-unexpected-body=false

* Move recommendation/validations to oas package and add javadoc comments

* Refactor and test recommendation validations

* Refactor validation function signatures to return explicit state rather than boolean

* Add operation recommendation for GET/HEAD w/body",f06ac9d91c19b93d488803ed09959560a871deb8,2020-01-31 13:57:15,3.0,1,Openapi-generator,22c6c0ca68aee25ca7923f7eff85079f9dc08376,4.5,4.0,5.0,0.5773502691896257,7.0,3.0,11.0,4.618802153517006,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,15.0,8.082903768654761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,3.4641016151377544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.5,2.0,7.0,2.8867513459481287,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.5773502691896257,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,5.0,2.8867513459481287,35.5,23.0,48.0,14.433756729740644,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.309401076758503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.5,1.0,2.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.4641016151377544,52.0,46.0,58.0,6.92820323027551,9.0,1.0,17.0,9.237604307034012,656.0,131.0,2139.0,988.9044443220993,62.5,39,86,27.13546265191241,5.0,1,9,4.618802153517006,1166,0.03344768439108062,0.10034305317324185,603.3350399999998,360.07261745664,7608.959999999999,1165.545329841176,1.0,-2.2991604321126817,0
