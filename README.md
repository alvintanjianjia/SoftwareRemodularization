# SoftwareRemodularization (MoveItOrNot)


## To Run Streamlit
streamlit run streamlit/src/app.py --global.dataFrameSerialization="legacy"


## 1. Introduction
MoveItOrNot (MION) aims to introduce a new approach that evaluates the effectiveness of software remodularisation techniques by prodiving information about their their suitability according to the features of the software systems, which as a consequence, enables the selection of the best algorithm for a particular software system.


## 2. How to Use
### Download and Installation
MION is written in Python.

### Input

### Output


## 3. How to contribute
### Support new languages
MION so far only supports Java. Please feel free to leverage this framework to add your own SoftwareRemodularizator. The effort needed for each language varies a lot.

### Enhance language features and fix issues
Currently, the parsing of the source files are done at a basic level. There are many language-specific features that requires special attention and should be taken into consideration during the parsing of the source files.

### Create useful tools
You could use MION as a building block to create various tools, either open source or commercial, for productions or research, such as GUI tools, code visualization tools, etc.

### Become a sponsor
It will help us a great deal if your company or institue becomes a sponsor of our project. Your donation could help MION to be independent, sustainable, and support more contributors.

## Tell us your thoughts
You are welcome to use MION in your projects, either open source or commercial ones, as well as software engineering research. Your feedback is highly appreciated. We will also be thankful if you could help us spread the words and encourage more people to use it.
