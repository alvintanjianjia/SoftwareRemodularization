* [dart-dio] Remove old Dart 1.x templates

* [dart-dio] Initial version of a next-gen Dart Dio generator

* Fix a couple readme links and examples

* Fix import in testcase

* Add integration tests to master POM

* Run initial dart format and improve some base formatting

* Generate docs

* Use integer matchers in test for content-length

* Separate more built_value specific files

* Fix mustache partial path

* Update pubspec template

* Fix tests after mock lib updates

* Generate with new built_value pre-release

This solves the problem of not being able to serialize null.

* Update built_value dependency

* Regenerate after merge

* Regenerate tests

* Fix missing byte response cast

* Update dio to 4.0.0-prev1

* Run format

* Ignore unused imports in inheritance classes

* Update mock test library

* Update docs

* Make a couple variables final

* Update and freeze dio dependency

* Update generator doc

* Add a new option to post processes all dart output at once

This is much faster than individual files. The committed samples should be formatted since Dart is very opinionated and it makes diffs in PRs much easier to read.
Due to this, we also need to format in CI, otherwise there is a git diff.

* [core] Refactor templating management

This refactors template management to get logic out of DefaultGenerator
and to provide a cleaner API to template search and read/compile.

Deprecates MockDefaultGenerator, which is not a mock and causes
in-memory retention of file contents. Maintainers should prefer
executing a ""dryRun"" with new DefaultGenerator(true) or do true
mock/spies if evaluating template intermediaries is truly necessary.
Tests may read written files with lower overhead than the in-process
retention of those bytes.

This attempts to maintain some compatibility with existing templating
adapter interfaces. Any breaking change here would be unintentional but
minimal effort to retarget the new interface.

* Tests for dry run file outputs

* Update API usage in Meta, test TemplateManager

* Wait on lastModified, lookup by filename in SpringCodegenTest

* Test DefaultGenerator + ignore file

* Move config.processOpenAPI in DefaultGenerator

* Fix wrong use of libraries templateDirector (java)

The samples scripts for Java incorrectly referenced the libraries
directories directly rather than the upper-level Java directory. This
was incorrect usage of template directories, because the generator
expects to be given the ""language"" directory and perform a lookup for
missing templates in the order:

* user defined libraries directory
* user defined language root
* embedded libraries directory
* embedded language root
* _common directory

This is incorrect in our samples scripts because a user or maintainer
has the expectation that any template change to files at the Java/ root
should also be honored on generation if the script specifies a custom
template directory.

* Fix handlebars extension usage, clean up Meta tasks

HandlebarseEngineAdapter previously didn't handle files without
extensions in the same was as the MustacheEngineAdapter. This now allows
for files without extension (or dotfiles) to lookup in the same
location.

Meta tasks are cleaned up to use template manager only, rather than
attempting to create an ""empty"" generator to use the previous templating
specific methods.

* Update kotlin-multiplatform gradle wrapper

* Rename GraphQL .gitignore template

The .gitignore file is unable to load via classpath resource from the
graphql node server resource directory (for unknown reasons). Before
this change, the missing template would fail silently.

A .gitignore file may exist in other directories and load as expected.
Added a default .gitignore to _common as a fallback so as not to break
any custom generators which may also be failing silently.

* Log entire stacktrace in go sdk built by gradle in AppVeyor

* Rename PHP .gitignore to gitignore

Java resources may not load .gitignore, this follows suit with other
generators and uses ""gitignore"" (some use ""gitignore.mustache"").

* [php] Rename .gitignore templates to gitignore

* Use same classpath lookup in common locator

* [rust] Properly escape empty triple-braces

* :shirt::art: Minor refactor DefaultGenerator

This cleans up some lint warnings and improve general code cleanliness
of DefaultGenerator.

Specifically:

* logger strings are now using the built-in log formatter rather than
  constructing new strings regardless of log level.
* Diamond operators are used where possible
* Some long-unused commented code has been removed
* Lambdas are used where possible
* Redundant operations are merged (HashMap constructor used rather than
  subsequent putAll on a collection, for example)

* [cli][core] Add support for dry-run and display

CLI now supports `--dry-run`, which will output a file change status

updates the docs. All options in the README have been reordered to match

* [core] Extracting recommendations to validation framework

This is work to extract recommendation logic out of the CLI validate command
into a shared evaluation instance which can be used elsewhere (such as Gradle,
or the Online tool).

For now, these validations are in addition to those provided by swagger-parser and
are only the following recommendations:

* Apache/Nginx warning that header values with underscore are dropped by default
* Unused models/schemas
* Use of properties with oneOf, which is ambiguous in OpenAPI Specification

I've allowed for disabling recommendations via System properties, since this is
something that has been requested a few times by users. System properties in this
commit include:

* openapi.generator.rule.recommendations=false
  - Allows for disabling recommendations completely. This wouldn't include all warnings
    and errors, only those we deem to be suggestions
* openapi.generator.rule.apache-nginx-underscore=false
  - Allows for disabling the Apache/Nginx warning when header names have underscore
  - This is a legacy CGI configuration, and doesn't affect all web servers
* openapi.generator.rule.oneof-properties-ambiguity=false
  - We support this functionality, but the specification may not intend for it
  - This is more to reduce noise
* openapi.generator.rule.unused-schemas=false
  - We will warn when a schema is not referenced outside of Components, which
    users have requested to be able to turn off
* openapi.generator.rule.anti-patterns.uri-unexpected-body=false

* Move recommendation/validations to oas package and add javadoc comments

* Refactor and test recommendation validations

* Refactor validation function signatures to return explicit state rather than boolean

* Add operation recommendation for GET/HEAD w/body",f06ac9d91c19b93d488803ed09959560a871deb8,2020-01-31 13:57:15,3.0,1,openapi-generator,22c6c0ca68aee25ca7923f7eff85079f9dc08376,4.5,4,5,0.5773502691896257,7.0,3,11,4.618802153517006,1.0,1,1,0.0,8.0,1,15,8.082903768654761,0.0,0,0,0.0,5.0,2,8,3.4641016151377544,0.0,0,0,0.0,4.5,2,7,2.8867513459481287,0.5,0,1,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.5,0,1,0.5773502691896257,0.5,0,1,0.5773502691896257,0,0,0,0.0,0.5,0,1,0.5773502691896257,0,0,0,0.0,2.5,0,5,2.8867513459481287,35.5,23,48,14.433756729740644,3.0,1,5,2.309401076758503,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,2.0,2,2,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,2.0,2,2,0.0,1.5,1,2,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,4.0,1,7,3.4641016151377544,52.0,46,58,6.92820323027551,9.0,1,17,9.237604307034012,656.0,131.0,2139.0,988.9044443220993,62.5,39,86,27.13546265191241,5.0,1,9,4.618802153517006,1166,0.03344768439108062,1.0,603.3350399999999

* [typescript] Clean up modelPropertyNaming across generators
Fixes https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/2976

Generators without runtime models conversion use ""original"" property naming by default. It's still possible to change it via cli options

Generators with runtime conversion keep using ""camelCase""

* Refactoring: use enum instead of string for modelPropertyNaming

* Restore the original camelCase for var names, decouple it from property names

* [all] Move feature set setter (#5460)

When I originally implemented the feature set code, I added the
getter/setter on DefaultCodegen and CodegenConfig as well as on
GeneratorMetadata. GeneratorMetadata also includes the library variation
features. When I went to add library-specific features, I realized the
discrepancy.

This removes the public setter from DefaultCodegen/CodegenConfig, and
adds a protected modifyFeatureSet which accepts a lambda and hides the
builder logic away in the method.

This will be a breaking change for anyone who's created a custom
generator in 4.2.3, so the impact is very limited.

* [core] Sanitize/underscore/camelize cache expiry (#5484)

The helper methods for sanitize/underscore/camelize were recently
updated to cache values in static maps. This would lead to a memory leak
in hosted environments as the maps had no cleanup/expiry.

This moves those cached entries to Caffeine caches with expiry based on
last access to allow the edge-case performance improvement gains on very
large documents, without the memory leak in hosted or embedded
environments.

Additionally, the defaultPackage for markdown is ""/Models"", so this
looked pretty in the heading for model files. So this prefix has been

* [kotlin][client] Some kotlin client enhancements

- Don't use JsonFormat for Date objects, this should be controlled via
  a custom serializer/deserializer or a turning on and off serialization
  features of Jackson.  I've updated the jacksonObjectMapper config to
  write the dates as strings, which I think was intended in the original
  commit.
  https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.6/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/SerializationFeature.html#WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS
  https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.6/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/cfg/MapperConfig.html#getDateFormat--
- Dont' use @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT) for enums.
  This causes Enums to be formatted as objects with an internal ""value""
  field.  In reality, OpenAPI enums are just strings without properties
  and should be treated as a string.
  https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-serialize-enums#2-enum-as-json-object
- Add's Kotlin use site annotation @get: to JsonProperty for parent interface
  properties.  Otherwise Kotlin will warn:
  ""This annotation is not applicable to target 'member property without
  backing field or delegate'""
- Add's JsonTypeInfo annotations to interfaces for inheritance.  This
  was copied verbatim from the kotlin-spring generator.

* Include version --full for equiv to --version

* [cli] Add --global-property for -D replacement (#5687)

-D option has been deprecated as it was previously used to:

* Pass ""system properties""
* Pass additional properties

This was confusing because we already have --additional-properties and
because Java System Properties are passed as -D before program
arguments.

Confusion around the -D option had existed for some time, but when we
introduced the thread-safe GlobalSettings to avoid overwriting Java
System Properties, we created a hard break from Java System Properties
in the generator. This also disconnected the previous ""system
properties"" from accepting additional properties.

Once these newly deprecated methods are removed, we will have a clear
separation of concerns between:

* Java System Properties
* Global generator properties (used as workflow context)
* Additional properties (used as generator options)

This commit marks multiple places for cleanup in 5.0. These will be
breaking changes, and lower effort to break in 5.0 with deprecation
warnings now rather than adding sibling properties throughout the code
and potentially introducing logic errors.

* python server: Add pythonSrcRoot option

This will allow the python project to be in a subdirectory (as specified
in pythonSrcRoot). That could mean following the src layout with sources
under src/ or lib/. Multi-language projects might use a sub directory
like python/, or whatever makes sense for the project.

By default, the pythonSrcRoot is """", meaning the existing behavior is
the default.

Issue about the python 3 tests:
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/5235

I couldn't find an issue about the python2 tests being disabled.
I'm guessing build errors like the following were the trigger:
https://travis-ci.org/github/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/builds/634238181

Let's see what breaks!

* [Python] Copy setup.py to python-aiohttp

* [Python] Save history while copying setup.py to python-aiohttp

* [Python] Add aiohttp server setup.py

* [Python] bump Flask-Testing version

* [Python] Pin pyyaml for py2.7 flask server

* [Python] simplify flask server requirements

* [Python] rebuild python server samples

* [Python] Fix python server requirements for older pythons

Documented minimum python version for our aiohttp server is 3.5.
Documented minimum python version for our flask server is 3.4.
Connexion 2.3 is the last version to support python 3.4 and 3.5, so fix
the version pinning to correctly select <=2.3 for these EOL python
versions. Newer pythons should get the latest if possible as there many
relevant bug fixes.

Werkzeug also needs to be pinned for these old versions in the aiohttp
server just like for the flask server.

3.4 and 3.5 are EOL. We really should increase the minimum supported
version, but that is for another PR to do.

* [cli] Some CLI improvements

* Introduce --version
* Introduce --help
* Add --sha to version command for short SHA display
* Output Version and SHA details
* In new --version output, display repo and doc site

Additional cleanup to suppress warnings and code quality.

* [docker] Adds labels for metadata

This adds image labels to store metadata on the online and cli docker
images, using standard labels:

* org.opencontainers.image.created
* org.opencontainers.image.revision
* org.opencontainers.image.title
* org.opencontainers.image.version

These can be inspected via 'docker inspect IMAGE_NAME' and may be useful
in tooling/automation or bug reports submitted by users.
