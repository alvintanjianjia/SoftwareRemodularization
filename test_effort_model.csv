### What changes are proposed in this pull request?

Fix https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13828 and fix
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues/13050

This patch will fix a miscaculation of block to async cache

In earlier Alluxio versions prior to
https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/13064, users may see the
following errors:
```
2021-03-12 08:36:48,521 ERROR AlluxioFuseFileSystem - Failed to read
file=/data/0.5G_9.txt, offset=536862720, size=8192
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 4, Size: 4
```

After 13064, we will not see the error anymore but caching the last
block when fileSize happens on block size boundary will fail silently.

### Why are the changes needed?

Correct a bug when calculating the block id to async cache, when current
pos is fileSize which is a multiple of blockSize

### Does this PR introduce any user facing changes?

No

Add functions to URIStatus to track bytes read from cache and external
file system in a per-read basis.
The default implementation does nothing. It is up to the subclass to
decide how to track them.
Presto will use this information to compute query level metrics.
See https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/16237 for details.

Adjust all the CommandMessageFilter implementations to be
de-/serializable through the JacksonSerializer. As such it would be
beneficial to provide distinct parameterized serialization test cases
for all implementations, going over the set of available serializers.
This will likely adjust all CommandMessageFilter impls to contain JSON

The AggregateCreationPolicy#ALWAYS will default to returning the
aggregate identifier after command handling. Similar to a command
handling constructor. However, this policy allows to be placed on
regular methods thus opening up to several return values. Hence, default
 to the aggregate identifier if no result is returned. Otherwise, return
 the result of command handling.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

This fixes two problems with S3Guard authoritative mode and
the auth directory flags which are stored in DynamoDB.

1. mkdirs was creating dir markers without the auth bit,
   forcing needless scans on newly created directories and
   files subsequently added; it was only with the first listStatus call
   on that directory that the dir would be marked as authoritative -even
   though it would be complete already.

2. listStatus(path) would reset the authoritative status bit of all
   child directories even if they were already marked as authoritative.

Issue #2 is possibly the most expensive, as any treewalk using listStatus
(e.g globfiles) would clear the auth bit for all child directories before
listing them. And this would happen every single time...
essentially you weren't getting authoritative directory listings.

For the curious, that the major bug was actually found during testing
-we'd all missed it during reviews.

A lesson there: the better the tests the fewer the bugs.

Maybe also: something obvious and significant can get by code reviews.

Contributed by Steve Loughran.

Replaces the committer-specific terasort and MR test jobs with parameterization
of the (now single tests) and use of file:// over hdfs:// as the cluster FS.

The parameterization ensures that only one of the specific committer tests
run at a time -overloads of the test machines are less likely, and so the
suites can be pulled back into the parallel phase.

There's also more detailed validation of the stage outputs of the terasorting;
if one test fails the rest are all skipped. This and the fact that job
output is stored under target/yarn-${timestamp} means failures should
be more debuggable.

This is causing the difference in samples

* :shirt::art: Minor refactor DefaultGenerator

This cleans up some lint warnings and improve general code cleanliness
of DefaultGenerator.

Specifically:

* logger strings are now using the built-in log formatter rather than
  constructing new strings regardless of log level.
* Diamond operators are used where possible
* Some long-unused commented code has been removed
* Lambdas are used where possible
* Redundant operations are merged (HashMap constructor used rather than
  subsequent putAll on a collection, for example)

* [cli][core] Add support for dry-run and display

CLI now supports `--dry-run`, which will output a file change status
similar to git status --porcelain.

The user may also specify `--verbose` for a one-liner below each file

Prior to this commit, MySQLMaxValueIncrementer could not be used when
the MySQL database was configured to use safe-updates mode.

See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-tips.html#safe-updates

This commit introduces a `limit 1` clause to the generated update
statement to allow MySQLMaxValueIncrementer to be compatible with
MySQL safe-updates mode.
